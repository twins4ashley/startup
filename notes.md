GitHub is useful for saving work and seeing changes, if your computer dies the work is still in GitHub! Commit often!!!
# Notes
- IP 18.207.56.180
- made elastic so that it has the same IP address and doesn't change
- Command to remote shell into server: ssh -i [key pair file] ubuntu@[ip address]
- keep pair secret, keep pair safe
- brings you to console window for the web server you just launched and in ubuntu user's home directory

- the * can be put in the subdomain so that anything.yourdomain will bring up your website
- domain name journey2paradise.click
 
**Caddy**
- handles all creation and rotation web certificates, allows easy set up HTTPS
- serves up all your HTML, CSS, JavaScript files, all early application work hosted on static files
- acts as gateway for subdomain requests to your Simon and startup application services - when request made to simon.yourdomain Caddy will proxy the request to the Simon application running with node.js as an internal web service

**HTTPS, TLS, and web certificates**
- _traceroute_ shows how many computers your connection goes through
- _HTTPS_ - Secure Hypertext Transport Protocol
- secure connection means all data is encrypted using TLS protocol
- TLS works by negotiating a shared secret that is then used to encrypt data
- see actual negotiation happens by using console browser based application _curl_, along with _-v_ parameter to see verbose output of HTTPS exchange, _> /dev/null_ redirection throws away actual HTTP response since only care about negotiation by redirecting output to null device
- core piece handshake is exchange web certificate that identifies domain name of server creating the secure connection
- browser compare certificate domain name to one represented in URL and if no match or certificate invalid or out of date, will display massive warning
- web certificates generated by trusted 3rd party using public/private key encryption
- Caddy uses Let's Encrypt to generate a web certificate every time an HTTPS request is made for a domain name that Caddy doesn't have a web certificate for
- You can obtain, and renew, a web certificate by enabling the ACME protocol for your web server and communicating with Let's Encrypt to generate the needed certificates
