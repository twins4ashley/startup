GitHub is useful for saving work and seeing changes, if your computer dies the work is still in GitHub! Commit often!!!
# Notes
- IP 18.207.56.180
- made elastic so that it has the same IP address and doesn't change
- Command to remote shell into server: ssh -i [key pair file] ubuntu@[ip address]
- keep pair secret, keep pair safe
- brings you to console window for the web server you just launched and in ubuntu user's home directory

- the * can be put in the subdomain so that anything.yourdomain will bring up your website
- domain name journey2paradise.click
 
**Caddy**
- handles all creation and rotation web certificates, allows easy set up HTTPS
- serves up all your HTML, CSS, JavaScript files, all early application work hosted on static files
- acts as gateway for subdomain requests to your Simon and startup application services - when request made to simon.yourdomain Caddy will proxy the request to the Simon application running with node.js as an internal web service

**HTTPS, TLS, and web certificates**
- _traceroute_ shows how many computers your connection goes through
- _HTTPS_ - Secure Hypertext Transport Protocol
- secure connection means all data is encrypted using TLS protocol
- TLS works by negotiating a shared secret that is then used to encrypt data
- see actual negotiation happens by using console browser based application _curl_, along with _-v_ parameter to see verbose output of HTTPS exchange, _> /dev/null_ redirection throws away actual HTTP response since only care about negotiation by redirecting output to null device
- core piece handshake is exchange web certificate that identifies domain name of server creating the secure connection
- browser compare certificate domain name to one represented in URL and if no match or certificate invalid or out of date, will display massive warning
- web certificates generated by trusted 3rd party using public/private key encryption
- Caddy uses Let's Encrypt to generate a web certificate every time an HTTPS request is made for a domain name that Caddy doesn't have a web certificate for
- You can obtain, and renew, a web certificate by enabling the ACME protocol for your web server and communicating with Let's Encrypt to generate the needed certificates

**Hyertext Markup Language (HTML)**
- element -	meaning
  - html -	The page container
  - head -	Header information
  - title -	Title of the page
  - meta	- Metadata for the page such as character set or viewport settings
  - script	- JavaScript reference. Either a external reference, or inline
  - include	- External content reference
  - body	- The entire content body of the page
  - header	- Header of the main content
  - footer	- Footer of the main content
  - nav	- Navigational inputs
  - main	- Main content of the page
  - section -	A section of the main content
  - aside	- Aside content from the main content
  - div	- A block division of content
  - span	- An inline span of content
  - h<1-9>	- Text heading. From h1, the highest level, down to h9, the lowest level
  - p	- A paragraph of text
  - b	- Bring attention
  - table -	Table
  - tr	- Table row
  - th	- Table header
  - td	- Table data
  - ol,ul	- Ordered or unordered list
  - li	- List item
  - a	- Anchor the text to a hyperlink
  - img	- Graphical image reference
  - dialog -	Interactive component such as a confirmation
  - form	- A collection of user input
  - input	- User input field
  - audio	- Audio content
  - video	- Video content
  - svg	- Scalable vector graphic content
  - iframe -	Inline frame of another HTML page
- Special characters need to use entity syntax (& is &amp;) (< is &lt;)
- The _img_, _audio_, and _video_ elements are all simple references to an external file, but _svg_ and _canvas_ both contain the code to render a visual image that can even be animated.
- external media
- Image example: <img alt=description src= />
- To include an audio file in your content you use the audio element and specify the src attribute with the URL to the source audio file. You can include the controls attribute if you want the user to be able to control the audio playback. If you do not display the controls then there is no visual representation of the audio in the rendered page. The autoplay attribute starts the audio playing as soon as the audio file is loaded, and the loop attribute keeps it playing over and over.
  - Audio example: <audio controls src=></audio>
- To include a video in your content you use the video element and specify the src attribute with the URL to the source video. Like the audio element you can include the controls or autoplay attributes. Note that you may need to include the crossorigin="anonymous" attribute if you are requesting files from a different domain than the one serving your content.
  - Example video: < video controls width="300" crossorigin="anonymous">
                 < source src="https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/BigBuckBunny.mp4" />
                  < /video>
- SVG is an extremely powerful and widely supported way to render graphics inline in your HTML. An example SVG graphic that draws a black border and a red circle looks like this:
  - < svg viewBox="0 0 300 200" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" stroke="red" fill="red" style="border: 1px solid #000000">
    < circle cx="150" cy="100" r="50" />
    </ svg>
- The canvas element was introduced to HTML in order to facilitate 2D drawing and animation. The HTML for the canvas element is fairly simple, but actually drawing on the canvas requires JavaScript support. Here again, is our simple red dot example.
  - < canvas id="canvasDemo" width="300" height="200" style="border: 1px solid #000000"></ canvas>
< script>
  const ctx = document.getElementById('canvasDemo').getContext('2d');
  ctx.beginPath();
  ctx.arc(150, 100, 50, 0, 2 * Math.PI);
  ctx.fillStyle = 'red';
  ctx.strokeStyle = 'red';
  ctx.fill();
  ctx.stroke();
</ script>
**Notes** (HTML)
- to deploy files go to console in project directory that you're working on then use: ./deployFiles.sh -k < yourpemkey> -h < yourdomain> -s simon
- to deploy the startup use ./deployFiles.sh -k < yourpemkey> -h < yourdomain> -s startup
- make sure you have saved in each file before deploying or changes won't be seen
- must have index.html cause is default browser will upload
- Span vs Div
  - Span - inline-level element, used for grouping small chunks of text, must not be nested to avoid confusion
  - Div - block-level element, used for grouping large chunks of text together, usually nested
  - use span when want style particular part content differently or manipulate with JavaScript

## CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
- padding, border, margin
- with CSS programmer can animate page, deploy custom fonts, respond to user actions, and dynamically alter entire layout of page based on size of device and its orientation
- CSS primarily concerned defining _rulesets_ (_rules_), comprised a _selector_ that selects elements to apply rule to (ex. p {...}), and one or more _declarations_ that represent _property_ (ex. color) to style with given _property value_ (ex. color)
- three ways associate CSS with HTML
  - use _style_ attribute of HTML element and explicitly assign one or more declarations (< p style=color...>) 
  - use HTML _style_ element to define CSS rules within HTML document appear in _head_ element of document so rules apply all elements of document (< head > < style > p{...} // < body >) 
  - use HTML _link_ element to create hyperlink reference to external file containing CSS rules must appear in _head_ element of document (< link rel = stylsheets href = styles.css>) (_link_ usually preferred)
- any declaration defined at lower level will override higher declaration
- CSS defines everything as boxes
  - innermost box holds element's content, where text or image displayed
  - next padding, padding inherit things like background color
  - next border, properties like color, thickness, and line style
  - final box is margin, considered external to actual styling of box and therefore only represents whitespace
  - by default width and height element defined by width and height content box, change _box-sizing_ CSS property from default value _content-box_ to _border-box_ order redefine width and height to also include padding and border (makes easier style elements when visual size matches actual size)
**CSS Selectors**
- descendant - list of descendants - _body section_ - any section descendant of a body
- child - list of direct children - _section > p_ - any p that direct child of a section
- general sibling - list of siblings - _div ~ p_ - any p has div sibling 
- adjacent sibling - list of adjacent sibling - _div + p_ - any p has adjacent div sibling
- class selector supply class name prefixed with period or combine element name and class selector
- ID selector, all IDs should be unique within HTML document so select targets specific element, use by prefix ID with hash symbol (#)
- attribute selectors allow select elements based upon attributes, a[href ] or more specific a[ href="./fish.png] or support wildcards specific text p[ href*="https://"]
- pseduo selector which select based on positional relationships, mouse interactions, hyperlink visitation states, and attributes

**CSS Frameworks**
- Tailwind - uses smaller definitions applied specifically to individual HTML elements, moves much of the CSS representation out of CSS file and directly into HTML
- can integrate Bootstrap into web applications simply by referencing Bootstrap CSS files from their content delivery network (CDN), then add the HTML link elements to your element like this... 
- if going use Bootstrap compnents that require JavaScript, will need also include Bootstrap's JavaScript module, add this by putting following at end of HTML body elements ... 
- use Bootstrap _btn_ CSS class button gets nice looking rounded appearance, _btn-primary_ shades button with current primary color for application (default blue)
  - < button type = " button" class = " btn btn-primary">
