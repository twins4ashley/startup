GitHub is useful for saving work and seeing changes, if your computer dies the work is still in GitHub! Commit often!!!
# Notes
- IP 18.207.56.180
- made elastic so that it has the same IP address and doesn't change
- Command to remote shell into server: ssh -i [key pair file] ubuntu@[ip address]
- keep pair secret, keep pair safe
- brings you to console window for the web server you just launched and in ubuntu user's home directory

- the * can be put in the subdomain so that anything.yourdomain will bring up your website
- domain name journey2paradise.click
 
**Caddy**
- handles all creation and rotation web certificates, allows easy set up HTTPS
- serves up all your HTML, CSS, JavaScript files, all early application work hosted on static files
- acts as gateway for subdomain requests to your Simon and startup application services - when request made to simon.yourdomain Caddy will proxy the request to the Simon application running with node.js as an internal web service

**HTTPS, TLS, and web certificates**
- _traceroute_ shows how many computers your connection goes through
- _HTTPS_ - Secure Hypertext Transport Protocol
- secure connection means all data is encrypted using TLS protocol
- TLS works by negotiating a shared secret that is then used to encrypt data
- see actual negotiation happens by using console browser based application _curl_, along with _-v_ parameter to see verbose output of HTTPS exchange, _> /dev/null_ redirection throws away actual HTTP response since only care about negotiation by redirecting output to null device
- core piece handshake is exchange web certificate that identifies domain name of server creating the secure connection
- browser compare certificate domain name to one represented in URL and if no match or certificate invalid or out of date, will display massive warning
- web certificates generated by trusted 3rd party using public/private key encryption
- Caddy uses Let's Encrypt to generate a web certificate every time an HTTPS request is made for a domain name that Caddy doesn't have a web certificate for
- You can obtain, and renew, a web certificate by enabling the ACME protocol for your web server and communicating with Let's Encrypt to generate the needed certificates

## Hyertext Markup Language (HTML)
- element -	meaning
  - html -	The page container
  - head -	Header information
  - title -	Title of the page
  - meta	- Metadata for the page such as character set or viewport settings
  - script	- JavaScript reference. Either a external reference, or inline
  - include	- External content reference
  - body	- The entire content body of the page
  - header	- Header of the main content
  - footer	- Footer of the main content
  - nav	- Navigational inputs
  - main	- Main content of the page
  - section -	A section of the main content
  - aside	- Aside content from the main content
  - div	- A block division of content
  - span	- An inline span of content
  - h<1-9>	- Text heading. From h1, the highest level, down to h9, the lowest level
  - p	- A paragraph of text
  - b	- Bring attention
  - table -	Table
  - tr	- Table row
  - th	- Table header
  - td	- Table data
  - ol,ul	- Ordered or unordered list
  - li	- List item
  - a	- Anchor the text to a hyperlink
  - img	- Graphical image reference
  - dialog -	Interactive component such as a confirmation
  - form	- A collection of user input
  - input	- User input field
  - audio	- Audio content
  - video	- Video content
  - svg	- Scalable vector graphic content
  - iframe -	Inline frame of another HTML page
- Special characters need to use entity syntax (& is &amp;) (< is &lt;)
- The _img_, _audio_, and _video_ elements are all simple references to an external file, but _svg_ and _canvas_ both contain the code to render a visual image that can even be animated.
- external media
- Image example: <img alt=description src= />
- To include an audio file in your content you use the audio element and specify the src attribute with the URL to the source audio file. You can include the controls attribute if you want the user to be able to control the audio playback. If you do not display the controls then there is no visual representation of the audio in the rendered page. The autoplay attribute starts the audio playing as soon as the audio file is loaded, and the loop attribute keeps it playing over and over.
  - Audio example: <audio controls src=></audio>
- To include a video in your content you use the video element and specify the src attribute with the URL to the source video. Like the audio element you can include the controls or autoplay attributes. Note that you may need to include the crossorigin="anonymous" attribute if you are requesting files from a different domain than the one serving your content.
  - Example video: < video controls width="300" crossorigin="anonymous">
                 < source src="https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/BigBuckBunny.mp4" />
                  < /video>
- SVG is an extremely powerful and widely supported way to render graphics inline in your HTML. An example SVG graphic that draws a black border and a red circle looks like this:
  - < svg viewBox="0 0 300 200" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" stroke="red" fill="red" style="border: 1px solid #000000">
    < circle cx="150" cy="100" r="50" />
    </ svg>
- The canvas element was introduced to HTML in order to facilitate 2D drawing and animation. The HTML for the canvas element is fairly simple, but actually drawing on the canvas requires JavaScript support. Here again, is our simple red dot example.
  - < canvas id="canvasDemo" width="300" height="200" style="border: 1px solid #000000"></ canvas>
< script>
  const ctx = document.getElementById('canvasDemo').getContext('2d');
  ctx.beginPath();
  ctx.arc(150, 100, 50, 0, 2 * Math.PI);
  ctx.fillStyle = 'red';
  ctx.strokeStyle = 'red';
  ctx.fill();
  ctx.stroke();
</ script>
**Notes** (HTML)
- to deploy files go to console in project directory that you're working on then use: ./deployFiles.sh -k < yourpemkey> -h < yourdomain> -s simon
- to deploy the startup use ./deployFiles.sh -k < yourpemkey> -h < yourdomain> -s startup
- make sure you have saved in each file before deploying or changes won't be seen
- must have index.html cause is default browser will upload
- Span vs Div
  - Span - inline-level element, used for grouping small chunks of text, must not be nested to avoid confusion
  - Div - block-level element, used for grouping large chunks of text together, usually nested
  - use span when want style particular part content differently or manipulate with JavaScript

## CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
- padding, border, margin
- with CSS programmer can animate page, deploy custom fonts, respond to user actions, and dynamically alter entire layout of page based on size of device and its orientation
- CSS primarily concerned defining _rulesets_ (_rules_), comprised a _selector_ that selects elements to apply rule to (ex. p {...}), and one or more _declarations_ that represent _property_ (ex. color) to style with given _property value_ (ex. color)
- three ways associate CSS with HTML
  - use _style_ attribute of HTML element and explicitly assign one or more declarations (< p style=color...>) 
  - use HTML _style_ element to define CSS rules within HTML document appear in _head_ element of document so rules apply all elements of document (< head > < style > p{...} // < body >) 
  - use HTML _link_ element to create hyperlink reference to external file containing CSS rules must appear in _head_ element of document (< link rel = stylsheets href = styles.css>) (_link_ usually preferred)
- any declaration defined at lower level will override higher declaration
- CSS defines everything as boxes
  - innermost box holds element's content, where text or image displayed
  - next padding, padding inherit things like background color
  - next border, properties like color, thickness, and line style
  - final box is margin, considered external to actual styling of box and therefore only represents whitespace
  - by default width and height element defined by width and height content box, change _box-sizing_ CSS property from default value _content-box_ to _border-box_ order redefine width and height to also include padding and border (makes easier style elements when visual size matches actual size)
### CSS Selectors
- descendant - list of descendants - _body section_ - any section descendant of a body
- child - list of direct children - _section > p_ - any p that direct child of a section
- general sibling - list of siblings - _div ~ p_ - any p has div sibling 
- adjacent sibling - list of adjacent sibling - _div + p_ - any p has adjacent div sibling
- class selector supply class name prefixed with period or combine element name and class selector
- ID selector, all IDs should be unique within HTML document so select targets specific element, use by prefix ID with hash symbol (#)
- attribute selectors allow select elements based upon attributes, a[href ] or more specific a[ href="./fish.png] or support wildcards specific text p[ href*="https://"]
- pseduo selector which select based on positional relationships, mouse interactions, hyperlink visitation states, and attributes
### CSS Declarations
- background-color	color	red	Fill the background color
- border	color width style	#fad solid medium	Sets the border using shorthand where any or all of the values may be provided

  - vh	A percentage of the viewport's height
  - vmin	A percentage of the viewport's smaller dimension
  - vmax	A percentage of the viewport's larger dimension
- color: keyword, RGB hex, RGB function, HSL
### CSS Fonts
- four major families of fonts: serif, sans-serif, fixed, and symbol
- in order have browser load font use @font-face rule and provide font name and source location
- easiest way use Google fonts use CSS import statement to reference Google Font Service, will automatically generate CSS for importing files
### CSS Animation
- use _animation_ properties and define _keyframes_ for what element should look like at different times in animation
### Responsive Design
- ability configure interface so application accommodates and takes advantage of screen's size and orientation
- display property 
  - none	Don't display this element. The element still exists, but the browser will not render it.
  - block	Display this element with a width that fills its parent element. A p or div element has block display by default.
  - inline	Display this element with a width that is only as big as its content. A b or span element has inline display by default.
  - flex	Display this element's children in a flexible orientation.
  - grid	Display this element's children in a grid orientation.
- meta tag in _head_ element of all HTML pages, tells browser not scale page
- float moves an element to left or right of its container element and allows inline elements to wrap around it
- @media selector dynamically detects size and orientation of a device and applies CSS rules to represent structure of HTML in way accommodates change
  - can use tell which side screen longest
  - can make entire pieces of your application disapper or move different location
### CSS Grid
- .container (container is a class) {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(300px, 1fr));
  grid-auto-rows: 300px;
  grid-gap: 1em;
}
### CSS Flexbox
- useful when want partition your application into areas that responsively move around as window resizes or orientation changes
- body {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  margin: 0;
  height: 100vh;
}
- flex: 0 80px zero means will not grow, 80px means has starting basis height 80 pixels, creates fized size box
- flex: 1 one means will get one fractional unit of growth
- can change medi query to none if screen gets to small (ex. don't show header and footer only main if screen small)
### CSS Frameworks
- Tailwind - uses smaller definitions applied specifically to individual HTML elements, moves much of the CSS representation out of CSS file and directly into HTML
- can integrate Bootstrap into web applications simply by referencing Bootstrap CSS files from their content delivery network (CDN), then add the HTML link elements to your element like this... 
- if going use Bootstrap compnents that require JavaScript, will need also include Bootstrap's JavaScript module, add this by putting following at end of HTML body elements ... 
- use Bootstrap _btn_ CSS class button gets nice looking rounded appearance, _btn-primary_ shades button with current primary color for application (default blue)
  - < button type = " button" class = " btn btn-primary">
- Bootstrap: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/

## JavaScript
- built in function _console.log_ output string to debugger console
- end JavaScript statements with semicolon and code blocks defined with curly braces
- see how long piece code running can wrap with _time_ and _timeEnd_ calls (output duration)
- see how many times block code called use _count_ function
- adding JavaScript to HTML
  - can insert JavaScript into HTML by directly including it in HTML content of a _< script>_ element, or by using _src_ attribute of script element to reference an external javascript file
### JavaScript type and construct
- variables declared using either _let_ or _const_ keyword (let allows change value of variable, const will give error if try change)
- primitive types
  - Null	The type of a variable that has not been assigned a value.
  - Undefined	The type of a variable that has not been defined.
  - Boolean	true or false.
  - Number	A 64-bit signed number.
  - BigInt	A number of arbitrary magnitude.
  - String	A textual sequence of characters.
  - Symbol	A unique value.
- object types
  - Object	A collection of properties represented by name-value pairs. Values can be of any type.	{a:3, b:'fish'}
  - Function	An object that has the ability to be called.	function a() {}
  - Date	Calendar dates and times.	new Date('1995-12-17')
  - Array	An ordered sequence of any type.	[3, 'fish']
  - Map	A collection of key-value pairs that support efficient lookups.	new Map()
  - JSON	A lightweight data-interchange format used to share information across programs.	{"a":3, "b":"fish"}
- common operators - ===(equality in math), for string variables + (concatenation) and === (equality)
- variable has type, but variable can change type when assigned new value or types automatically converted based upon context used in
  - 2 + '3'; // OUTPUT: '23'...2 * '3'; // OUTPUT: 6...[2] + [3]; // OUTPUT: '23'...true + null; // OUTPUT: 1...true + undefined; // OUTPUT: NaN
- === strict equality (!== strict inequality)
  - 1 === '1'; OUTPUT: false but 1 == '1'; OUTPUT: true
- loops
  - for
  - do while ... let i = 0; do { console.log(i); i++; } while (i < 2); // OUTPUT: 0 1
  - while
  - for in ... const obj = { a: 1, b: 'fish' }; for (const name in obj) {console.log(name);} // OUTPUT: a // OUTPUT: b
  - for of - iterates over an iterable's (array, map, set) property values
  - allow for either a _break_ or _continue_ statement to abort or advance the loop
### JavaScript string
- single quotes, double quotes, or backticks (`)
- backtick defines string literal may contain JS that is evaluated in place and concatenated into the string
- string literal replacement specifier declared with dollar sign followed by curly brace pair, anything inside {} evaluated as JS
- string functions
  - length	The number of characters in the string
  - indexOf()	The starting index of a given substring
  - split()	Split the string into an array on the given delimiter string
  - startsWith()	True if the string has a given prefix
  - endsWith()	True if the string has a given suffix
  - toLowerCase()	Converts all characters to lowercase
### Functions
- can be assigned name, passed as parameter, returned as result, and referenced from an object like any other variable
- if parameter not provided then value of parameter is _undefined_ when function executes
- function can define default value, assinging value to parameter in function declaration
- anonymous functions - functions commonly assigned to variable so can be passed as parameter to some other function or stored as object property, can define function anonymously and assign to a variable
- creating, passing, and returning functions
- functions can be declared inside other functions, allows you modularize code without always exposing private details
### JavaScript arrow function
- make code more compact, syntax replaces need for _function_ keyword with symbols _=>_ placed after parameter declaration
- arrow functions cannot be used for constructors or iterator generators
- no curly braces, result of expression automatically returned
- curly braces, if don't put return _____ then will return undefined
- arrow functions inherit _this_ pointer from scope where it is created, makes _closure_ allows function continue referencing its creation scope even after passed out of that scope
  - can remember values of variables when function created instead what they are when are executed
- _debounce_ function only execute specified function once within given time window, any requests execute debounce function more frequently cause time window reset
### JavaScript array
- array objects represent sequence other objects and primitives
- push	Add an item to the end of the array	a.push(4)
- pop	Remove an item from the end of the array	x = a.pop()
- slice	Return a sub-array	a.slice(1,-1)
- sort	Run a function to sort an array in place	a.sort((a,b) => b-a)
- values	Creates an iterator for use with a for of loop	for (i of a.values()) {...}
- find	Find the first item satisfied by a test function	a.find(i => i < 2)
- forEach	Run a function on each array item	a.forEach(console.log)
- reduce	Run a function to reduce each array item to a single item	a.reduce((a, c) => a + c)
- map	Run a function to map an array to a new array	a.map(i => i+i)
- filter	Run a function to remove items	a.filter(i => i%2)
- every	Run a function to test if all items match	a.every(i => i < 3)
- some	Run a function to test if any items match	a.some(i => 1 < 1)
### JSON
- JavaScript Object Notation
- provide simple, effective way share and store data
- easily convertible to and from JavaScript objects
- most common JSON document contains object ({"a":1,"b":"words"})
- can convert JSON to, and from, JS using _JSON.parse_ and _JSON.stringify_
- JSON cannot represent JS undefined object so gets dropped when converting from JS to JSON
### JavaScript object and classes
- objects have common object-oriented functionality such as constructors, a _this_ pointer, static properties and functions, and inheritance
- preperties of object can be referenced either with dot (_obj.prop) or bracket notation (obj[' prop'])
- declare variable of object type with _object-literal_ syntax, provide initial composition of object
- static functions associated with
  - entries	Returns an array of key value pairs
  - keys	Returns an array of keys
  - values	Returns an array of values
- any function that returns object is considered a _constructor_ and can be invoked with _new_ operator
- _this_ depends of scope, in context object refers to a pointer to the object
- can use classes to define objects
- using class clarifies intent create reusable component rater than one-off object
- classes have explicit constructor and assumed function declarations
- can make properties and functions of classes private by prefixing with a _#_
- classes can be extended using _extends_ keyword to define inheritance
  - parameters that need be passed parent class delivered using _super_ function
  - parent's function explicitly accessed using _super_ keyword
### JavaScript regular expressions
- match, replace, search, split, test (see if match)
### JavaScript rest and spread
- call with any number of parameters and all automatically combined into an array use _rest_ parameter by prefix with three periods
- spread opposite of rest, take object iterable (array or string) and expands into function's parameters
### JavaScript exceptions
- try {
  // normal execution code
} catch (err) {
  // exception handling code
} finally {
  // always called code
}
### JavaScript destructuring
- process pulling individual items out of an existing one, or removing structure
- arrays or objects
- rest syntax ...others
- destructuring objects explicitly specify properties want pull from source object
- can map names to new variables instead using original property names
- default values may be provided for missing ones
- can use to reassign existing variables
### Scope
- types scope
  - global - visible to all code
  - module - visible to all code running in a module
  - function - visible within a function
  - block - visible within a block of code delimited by curly braces
- var ignores block scope
- _this_ represents variable that point object that contains context within scope of currently executing line of code
  - Global - When this is referenced outside a function or object it refers to the globalThis object. The globalThis object represents the context for runtime environment. For example, when running in a browser, globalThis refers to the browser's window object.
  - Function - When this is referenced in a function it refers to the object that owns the function. That is either an object you defined or globalThis if the function is defined outside of an object. Note that when running in JavaScript strict mode, a global function's this variable is undefined instead of globalThis.
  - Object - When this is referenced in an object it refers to the object.
- closure defined function and surrounding state
- whatever variables accessible when function created available inside function
### JavaScript modules
- must explicitly _export_ objects from one file and then _import_ into another file
**Document Object Model**
**Local Storage**
### Promises
- long running, or blocking tasks, should be executed with use of JS _Promise_
- allows main rendering thread continue while some action executed in background
- different states
  - pending - currently running asynchronously
  - fulfilled - completed successfully
  - rejected - failed to complete
- _setTimeout_ function create delay in execution of code
- set state _fulfilled_ when things complete correctly or _rejected_ when error happens
- promise executer function takes two functions as parameters, _resolve_ and _reject_
- has three functions: then, catch, and finally
  - then called if promise fulfilled
  - catch called if promise rejected
  - finally always called after all processing completed
### JavaScript Async/await
- _await_ keyword wraps execution of promise and removed need to chain functions, will block until promise state moves to fulfilled or throw exception if state moves rejected
- cannot call await unless called at top level of JS, or in function defined with _async_ keyword
- _async_ keyword transforms function so returns promise that will resolve to value that was previously returned by function, basically turns any function into asynchronous function so can in turn make asynchronous requests
- _async_ keyword declares function returns a promise, _await_ keyword wraps call to _async_ function blocks execution until promise resolved then returns result of promise
